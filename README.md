# Alliance-Optimization-Model
This project applies machine learning to support FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) game plans before matches along with alliance selection during play-offs using data-driven analysis. A Gradient Boosting (CatBoost primary) classifier evaluates teams based on training data from the most up to date team performances. The system also focuses on comparing both our team's data to another to come up with a rank list for our best matches and game data through, line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps through visual insights made using seaborn. To add to this, this machine learning model also prints out valuable insights for game strategy for each allianc...
